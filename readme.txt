=======

Spdifer is a DirectShow filter that allows media players to passthrough 
multi-channel sound to the digital (SPDIF) output without any change, so an 
external receiver can decode it.

Supports passthrough for AC3, DTS and MPEG Audio formats.
All passthrough features of the 'big brother' AC3Filter are supported.

This filter is a part if AC3Filter project.
